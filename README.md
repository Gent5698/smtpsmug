# smtpsmug

Script to help analyze mail servers for SMTP Smuggling vulnerabilities.

# docs

`smtpsmug` allows sending mails to an smtp server and ending it with various malformed
end of data symbol. This tests whether servers are affected by SMTP Smuggling
vulnerabilities. Please consider this preliminary and work in progress, I am still
trying to fully understand the issue myself.

By default, `smtpsmug` will send a test mail ending with a '\n.\n' symbol (Unix newlines
instead of Windows '\r\n' newlines). It supports multiple other malformed endings. Use
`--list-tests` to show them, `--test [testname]` to select one.

To test the postfix mitigation, there is now a `pipelining` test. (May be unstable.)

There are multiple behaviors of mail servers that enable the vulnerability:

* Mail servers accept malformed endings. This is in all cases a bug and a violation of
  [RFC 5321, section 4.1.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321#section-4.1.1.4).

* Mail servers accept malformed endings within mails and forward them to other mail
  servers. To test this, you need to monitor the receiving side. (The
  [fake-mail-server](https://github.com/Email-Analysis-Toolkit/fake-mail-server) by
  Damian Poddebniak, written for our previous STARTTLS research, can be used for this.)

* The safest behavior is for mail servers to never send or accept any solo '\r' or '\n'
  characters and always answer with an error if they see them outside of an '\r\n'
  combination. The standard is clear that implementations MUST NOT transmit such
  characters, therefore rejecting such solo newlines will never cause problems with
  correct implementations. Some mail servers will still accept such characters, adhering
  to the now widely considered obsolete robustness principle ( "be conservative in what
  you send, be liberal in what you accept"). This is not a good idea. ([RFC 5321,
  section 3.2.8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-2.3.8) states:
  "SMTP client implementations MUST NOT transmit these characters except when they are
  intended as line terminators and then MUST, as indicated above, transmit them only as
  a <CRLF> sequence." This appears clear that conforming clients must not send such
  stray characters, but it does not explicitly say what receiving servers should do in
  such a case.)

# warning

This tool is not a simple "check and get a result" tool. It requires interpreting the
results, and not all failing checks imply an SMTP smuggling vulnerability.
